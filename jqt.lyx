 Profile monitoring has attracted a growing interest in the literature in
 the past decades 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Woodall2004-bp,Woodall2007-xs,Maleki2018-uo"

\end_inset

 for its ability to construct control charts with much better representations
 for certain types of process measurements.
 A profile can be defined as a functional relationship between the response
 variables and explanatory variables or spatiotemporal coordinates.
 In this work, we focus on the case where the profiles generated from the
 process are high-dimensional (HD)—
\shape italic
i.e.
\shape default
, the number of such explanatory variables or spatiotemporal coordinates
 are large.
 Specifically, we focus on sets of HD profiles for which intra-sample variation
 lies on a nonlinear low-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Our motivating example of such HD profiles is presented in

In literature, profile monitoring techniques can be categorized by their
 assumptions on the type of the functional relationship that they assume.
 Linear profile monitoring can be considered the most basic profile monitoring
 technique, in which it is assumed that the profile can be represented by
 a linear function.
 The idea is to extract the slope and the intercept from each profile and
 monitor its coefficients 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zhu2009monitoring"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Regularization techniques can also be used in linear profile estimation.
 For example, Zou 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 utilize a multivariate linear regression model for profiles with the LASSO
 penalty and use the regression coefficients for Phase-II monitoring 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zou2012lasso"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the assumption of linear functional relationship can be quite
 limiting.
 To address this challenge, nonlinear parametric models are proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Williams2007-ty,Jensen2009-tu,Noorossana2011-oj,Maleki2018-uo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These models assume an explicit family of parameterized functions and,
 their parameter estimations are estimated via nonlinear regression.
 In any cases, the drawback of all parametric models is that these models
 assume the parametric form is known beforehand, which might not always
 be the case.

Another large body of profile monitoring research focuses on the type of
 profile data where the basis of the representation is assumed to be known
 but the coefficients are unknown.
 For instance, to monitor smooth profiles, various non-parametric methods
 based on local kernel regression 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zou2008monitoring,qiu2010nonparametric,zou2009nonparametric"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and splines 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chang2010statistical"

\end_inset

 are developed.
 To monitor the non-smooth wave-form signals, a wavelet-based mixed effect
 model is proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "paynabar2011characterization"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, for all the aforementioned methods, it is assumed that the nonlinear
 variation pattern of the profile is well captured by a known basis or kernel.
 Usually, there is no guidance on selecting the right basis of the representatio
n for the original data and it normally requires many trial and error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%Here, we focus on the HD profiles where we cannot assume a parametric function
 form and the basis representation is unknown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

In the case that the basis of HD profiles are not known, dimensionality
 reduction techniques are widely used.
 Principal component analysis (PCA) is arguably the most popular method
 in this context for profile data monitoring because of its simplicity,
 scalability, and good data compression capability.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "liu1995control"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, PCA is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the streaming data and,
 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 charts are constructed to monitor the extracted representations and residuals,
 respectively.
 To generalize PCA methods to monitor the complex correlation among the
 channels of multi-channel profiles, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "paynabar2015change"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 propose a multivariate functional PCA method and apply change point detection
 methods on the function coefficients.
 Along this line, tensor-based PCA methods are also proposed for multi-channel
 profiles, examples including uncorrelated multi-linear PCA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "paynabar2013monitoring"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and multi-linear PCA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "grasso2014profile"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, various tensor-based PCA methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "yan2015image"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are compared and different test statistics are developed for tensor-based
 process monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main limitation of all the aforementioned PCA-related methods is that
 the expressive power of linear transformations is very limited.
 Furthermore, each principal component represents a global variation pattern
 of the original profiles, which is not efficient at capturing the local
 spatial correlation within a single profile.
 Therefore, PCA requires a much larger latent space dimensions than the
 dimension of the actual latent space, yielding a sub-optimal and overfitting-pr
one representation.
 This phenomena hinders the profile monitoring performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A systematic discussion of this issue is articulated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Shi2016-tg"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In that work, the authors identify the problems associated with assuming
 a closeness relationship in the subspace that is characterized by Euclidean
 metrics.
 They successfully observe that the intra-sample variation in complex high-dimen
sional corpora may lie on a nonlinear manifold as opposed to a linear manifold
 which is assumed by PCA and related methods.
 However, the authors only focus on applying manifold learning for Phase-I
 analysis, while Phase-II monitoring procedure is not touched upon

 Aside from deterministic deep neural networks, only three works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 proposed to use deep probabilistic latent variable models, specifically,
 variational autoencoders (VAE), for Phase-II monitoring.
 All of the proposed monitoring statistics in those works differ slightly
 but conceptually they are all extensions of the classic 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

-charts of PCA.
 We argue that there is room for improvement for the monitoring statistic
 formulations in those works for a number of reasons, especially when high-dimen
sional profiles are considered.
 In this work, we propose a new monitoring statistic formulation to address
 this issue.
 The contributions of this work can be listed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We demonstrate why latent variable-based monitoring statistics should not
 be used due to the two issues related to deep encoders: (1) their representatio
ns are likely entangled, (2) they will likely fail to extrapolate well beyond
 the region of in-control profiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We demonstrate why observable variable-based monitoring statistics should
 not be estimated via sampling due to prohibitively expensive computational
 demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We propose a better monitoring statistic that responds robustly and in most
 cases more accurately than previous formulations.
 We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new formulation on both simulation
 and real-life case studies.

\begin_layout Subsection
Variational Autoencoders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we introduce Variational Autoencoder (VAE) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kingma2013-dl"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which is the primary modeling tool in this work.
 In order to do that, we believe a brief introduction to Gaussian factorized
 latent variable models is necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 Latent variables models are powerful tools to model complex distributions
 over high-dimensional spaces.
 The underlying assumption is that there exists a low-dimensional latent
 structure that explains well the variations in the high-dimensional observed
 space.
 Typically, the density over observed variables can be decoupled into the
 distribution on the latent variables and the conditional distribution of
 observed variables given latent variables can be assigned as tractable
 families of distributions, which will be much more efficient than modeling
 the data distribution directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical example of latent variable models is when the joint distribution
 is Gaussian factorized as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:gaussian-factorized"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\pz & =\Norm(\mbz;0,\mbI_{r})\\
\decoding & =\Norm(\mbx;\mu_{\mbtheta}(\mbz),\sigma^{2}\mbI_{d})\\
p_{\mbtheta}(\mbx,\mbz) & =\decoding\pz
\end{split}
\label{eq:gaussian-factorized}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the above formulation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx\in\R^{d}$
\end_inset

 are observed samples, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbz\in\R^{r}$
\end_inset

 are latent variables while 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\mbtheta}\colon\R^{r}\to\R^{d}$
\end_inset

 is a function parameterized by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbtheta\in\Theta$
\end_inset

, that describes the relationship between the latent variables and the mean
 of the conditional distribution.
 The Gaussian prior 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 is typically chosen to be standard to avoid degenerate solutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 307"
key "roweis1999unifying"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and conditional covariance is typically assumed to be isotropic 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}I_{d}$
\end_inset

 to avoid ill-defined problems.
 The aim is to approximate the true density 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\mbtheta}(\mbx)\approx p(\mbx)$
\end_inset

 and this approximation can be obtained through marginalization: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\mbtheta}(\mbx)=\int p_{\mbtheta}(\mbx,\mbz)d\mbz
\]

\end_inset

Finally, in literature, there has been discussions about whether the independent
 latent structure assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz=\Norm(\mbz;0,\mbI_{r})$
\end_inset

 can lead to the discovery of the true disentangled variations, a task also
 known as disentangled representation learning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "Sec. 3.5"
key "bengio2013representation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Disentangled representations are useful to represent variations in latent
 variations due to its ability to separate out the independent factors.
 We are interested in whether and if so, how, such representations will
 be critical for profile monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A famous member of the family of models described above is the probabilistic
 principal component analysis (PPCA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tipping1999probabilistic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The parameters are optimized via a maximum likelihood estimation framework
 and it can be solved analytically due to the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\mbtheta}$
\end_inset

 is a simple linear transformation enabling the optimization to reuse results
 from original solutions to the PCA problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumption of PPCA that the latent and observed variables have a strictly
 linear relationship can be quite restricting.
 In real-world processes, it is likely that this relationship is highly
 nonlinear.
 Deep latent variable models are a marriage of deep neural networks and
 latent variable models that aim to solve this problem.
 Deep learning has enjoyed a tremendous resurgence in the last decade due
 to their superior performance that was unprecedented for many tasks such
 as image classification

 In theory, under sufficient conditions, a two layer multilayer perceptron
 can approximate any function on a bounded region 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cybenko1989approximation,Hornik1991-li"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Growing the width of shallow networks in an exponential fashion for arbitrarily
 complex tasks is not practical.
 It has been shown that deeper representations can often achieve the better
 expressive power than shallow networks with less parameters due to the
 efficient reuse of the previous layers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "eldan2016power"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VAE is arguably the most foundational member of the deep latent variable
 model family.
 The main difference between PPCA and VAE is that the latter replace the
 linear transformation with a high-capacity deep neural network (called
 
\shape italic
generative
\shape default
 or 
\shape italic
decoder
\shape default
).
 This is powerful in the sense that along with a general purpose prior 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 a wide variety of densities can be modeled 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kingma2019introduction"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Unlike PPCA, these models will not have analytical solutions due to the
 complex nature of the neural network used.
 Like most other deep learning models, their parameters have to be optimized
 via gradient descent for maximum likelihood.
 The problem becomes even harder given the observation that the posterior
 
\begin_inset Formula $\decoding$
\end_inset

 takes meaningful values only for a small sub-region within 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{r}$
\end_inset

.
 This makes sampling from the prior 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 to estimate the likelihood prohibitively expensive.
 Both models work around this problem using the importance sampling framework
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) to approximate a proposal distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 —parametrized by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbphi$
\end_inset

— which will hopefully sample latent variables from a much smaller region
 that is more likely to produce higher posterior densities for a given input

The ultimate output of a trained VAE is the likelihood estimator.
 Once the two networks are trained, the log-likelihood

VAEs are trained to maximize the so-called evidence lower bound (ELBO),

Convolutional Layers

In this work, we use convolutional encoders and decoders in our VAE architecture.
 Introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lecun1989backpropagation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, convolutional layers have enabled tremendous performance increase in certain
 neural network applications where the data is of a certain spatial neighborhood
 structure such as images or audio waveform.
 They exploit an important observation of such data, where the learner should
 be equivariant to translations.
 This is an important injection of inductive bias into the network that
 largely reduce the number of parameters compared to the fully connected
 network by the use of parameter sharing.
 It eventually increase the statistical learning efficiency, especially
 for small samples.
 It must be noted however, convolutional layers are not equivariant to scale
 and rotation as they are to translation.
 Knowing what sort of inductive biases are injected into these layers is
 important for the understanding of disentanglement, which we will introduce
 later in this paper.

 The proposed control charting methodology suggests that these two statistics
 work in combination and at least one vote of either statistics is enough
 to make a detection.

Log-likelihood, 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\ptheta(\mbx)$
\end_inset

, arises as a natural candidate for monitoring statistic in the context
 of DLVMs.
 That is, given a well trained DLVM, in-control samples should have relatively
 higher log-likelihood than out-of-control samples.
 However, the required number of Monte Carlo samples—

\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 To address this issue, ELBO defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 can be used for a reasonable approximation:

To understand the role of both terms in process monitoring, we revisit the
 assumptions of the model described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Let us formally represent an out-of-control distribution as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx)\neq p(\mbx)$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mbx)=\int p(\mbx\g\mbz)p(\mbz)d\mbz$
\end_inset

, we can observe two sources of out-of-control behaviours: disturbances
 in latent distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)\neq\pz$
\end_inset

 and disturbances in observable distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx\g\mbz)\neq p(\mbx\g\mbz)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that various combinations of these two disturbances cover disturbances
 in the entire process.
 One can argue that 
\begin_inset Formula $\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}\log\decoding$
\end_inset

 can detect the disturbances in the observable space 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx\g\mbz)\neq p(\mbx\g\mbz)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\KL{\encoding}{p(\mbz)}$
\end_inset

 represents the change in the latent space 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)\neq\pz$
\end_inset

.
 We know that for processes that can be accurately modeled by PCA, both
 terms play an important role 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kim2003process"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for process monitoring.
 We argue that this holds true for PPCA too.
 To prove this, we link the monitoring statistics of PCA (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:bckgrnd:ReviewPCA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) to PPCA using the ELBO framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset

 We know from the definition of PPCA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tipping1999probabilistic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that the prior, encoding and decoding functions are normally distributed
 as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{split}p(\mbz) & =\Norm(0,\mbI)\\
\decoding & =\Norm(\mbW\mbz,\sigma^{2}\mbI)\label{eq:Gaussian}
\end{split}
\]

\end_inset

In this case, from PPCA, the encoder also follows the normal distribution
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding=\Norm(\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx),\Sigma_{z})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)=\mbM^{-1}\mbW^{\top}\mbx$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{z}=\sigma^{2}\mbM^{-1})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbM=\mbW^{\top}\mbW+\sigma^{2}\mbI$
\end_inset

.
 Then, the two monitoring statistics can be defined as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\KL{\encoding}{p(\mbz)}=\frac{1}{2}\gg\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)\gg^{2}+C_{1}\label{eqn:KL_PPCA}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbphi}}\log\decoding\propto\gg\mbx-\mbW\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)\gg^{2}+C_{2}\label{eqn:E_PPCA}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset

 are constants that doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 Note that the constants do not affect out-of-control decisions.

\begin_inset Formula $\KL{\encoding}{p(\mbz)}$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the

 are based on

\end_inset

 or in the case of PPCA

 We shall call these statistics, 
\emph on
latent-variable based statistics
\emph default
, as they rely exclusively on latent representations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first major claim is that latent variable-based statistics are not useful
 for profile monitoring when deep neural network based encoders are used
 to produce latent representations.
 We cite two reasons for that.
 First, for such high-dimensional complex processes, most of the change
 or disturbances should be expected on residual distribution.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "severson2016perspectives"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 faults in complex real-life processes tend to alter the existing relationship
 between latent sources of variation and what is observed, as opposed to
 pushing to most extreme cases in the latent variational sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the mean encoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\mbphi}$
\end_inset

—which is a deep encoder—is likely to lack two important features: disentangled
 representations and extrapolation capabilities.
 These two qualities are required so that extreme values of latent variables
 consistently converge out of in-control zone.
 We illustrate this in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:entang-extrap"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Observe how Point C is falsely identified as in-control when learned representa
tions are not disentangled or when they fail to extrapolate.

\begin_layout Standard
Theorem 1 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "locatello2018challenging"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 proves that without proper inductive biases injected into the model about
 sources of variation, it is impossible to find disentangled representations.
 Unfortunately, injecting such inductive biases requires detailed anticipation
 of variations among in-control samples as well as specialized neural network
 structures, both of which are extremely challenging tasks given the potential
 complexity of the processes that generates high-dimensional profiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, even if the representations are disentangled, correct mappings
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 may still not be obtained due to failure to extrapolate.
 Deep neural networks approximates well only at a bounded domain defined
 by where the training set—in our case, the in-control set—is densely sampled
 from.
 The behavior of the function is often unpredictable outside that domain.
 In other words, it may not extrapolate well beyond the domain of training
 samples.
 We refer interested readers to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:rosenbrock"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 where we replicated this phenomena on a toy example.
 To see why this is a problem, first note that the encoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 will only be trained with profiles densely sampled from the bounded region
 of in-control samples, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 are high.
 The behavior of the encoder is uncertain for profiles coming from dense
 regions of out-of-control latent structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)\neq\pz$
\end_inset

.
 We expect increased false negatives should the model falsely map these
 profiles onto high density regions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 but not 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike latent variable-based statistics, extrapolation and disentanglement
 issues in 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 along with extrapolation issues in 
\begin_inset Formula $\decoding$
\end_inset

 help observable variable-based statistic detect faults better.
 More interestingly, this holds true even when the disturbance is purely
 on the latent structure.
 Incorrect mappings by 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 will lead to incorrect generations by 
\begin_inset Formula $\decoding$
\end_inset

 and thus larger statistic that will fall beyond control limits.
 Second, even if the mapping was correct, we might have extrapolation issues
 in the decoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\decoding$
\end_inset

 which is another possibility for this statistic to capture disturbances
 in latent variations.
 To see why this is the case, note that the encoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 is optimized to produce samples more from where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 is large.
 In turn, the decoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\decoding$
\end_inset

 will mostly be trained on samples from where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)$
\end_inset

 is low.
 For disturbances in observable region 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx\g\mbz)\neq p(\mbx\g\mbz)$
\end_inset

, it is trivial to see how 
\begin_inset Formula $\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}\log\decoding$
\end_inset

 will be effective at capturing faults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of now, we have enough reasons to recommend the use of observable variable-ba
sed statistics as the only type of test statistic for a profile monitoring
 application that uses VAE.
 Indeed, variations of this type have been proposed previously: 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lee2019process"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wang2019systematic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, they both use random samples from the proposal distribution to
 estimate the expectation.
 This approach may require a large number of samples to be generated and
 thus a large number of forward passes on the decoder network, which is
 prohibitively expensive in terms of computation.
 We propose using first order Taylor expansion instead.
 We call this approximation 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE$
\end_inset

, which stands for expected reconstruction error due to the resemblance
 of this statistic to the reconstruction error in deterministic autoencoders.
 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE$
\end_inset

 can be derived as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
ERE & \triangleq\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}\log\decoding\label{eqn:propstat:final}\\
 & =\E_{\mbz\sim p_{\mbtheta}}\left[\log q_{\mbtheta}(\mbx\g\mbz-(\mu_{\mbphi}-\mbz))\right]\\
 & \approx\log\ptheta(\mbx\g\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))\\
 & \propto\gg\mbx-\mu_{\mbtheta}(\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))\gg_{2}^{2}+C_{3}
\end{align}

\end_inset

The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}$
\end_inset

 can be ignored given control charting logistics.
 Given a trained VAE, this quantity can be computed by forward passing the
 new profile from the process 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\mbphi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\mbtheta}$
\end_inset

 successively and calculating the squared prediction error, without any
 reparameterization.

Profile Monitoring Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 A typical profile monitoring follows two phases: Phase-I analysis, and
 Phase-II analysis.
 Phase-I analysis focuses on understanding the process variability by training
 an appropriate in-control mode, and selecting an appropriate control limit.
 In our case, Phase-I analysis results in a trained model (i.e.
 an encoder and a decoder) and an Upper Control Limit (UCL) to help setup
 the control chart for each of the monitoring statistics.
 In Phase-II, the system is exposed to new profiles generated by the process
 to decide whether these profiles are in-control or out-of-control.
 Our experimentation plan, outlined below, is formulated to emulate this
 scenario to effectively assess the performance of any combination of a
 model, a test statistic and a disturbance scenario.

In this section, we propose the setup and results of our simulation study.
 The rationale behind conducting a simulation study is to have full control
 and information over the data generating process.
 This way, we can test our claims we make in

.

 outlined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 We first evaluate the performance of the deep latent variable models in
 a simulation setting inspired by the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Shi2016-tg"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The simulation procedure produces 2D point clouds that resemble the scanned
 topology of a gasket bead.
 Let each pixel on a 
\begin_inset Formula $64$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $64$
\end_inset

 grid be denoted by a tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbp=(p_{0},p_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 The values of the tuples stretch from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, equally spaced, left to right and bottom-up.
 Each tuple takes a value based on its location through a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbp\mapsto f(\mbp;\czero,r)+\epsilon$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\sim\Norm(0,1\times10^{-2})$
\end_inset

 is i.i.d Gaussian noise.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is parametrized by the horizontal center location of the bead 
\begin_inset Formula $\czero$
\end_inset

, and the radius of the bead 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 The vertical center of the bead is fixed to be at the center.
 Given any parameter set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{c_{0},r\}$
\end_inset

, each pixel 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbp$
\end_inset

 can be evaluated with the following logic: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}g(\mbp;c_{0},r) & =1-\frac{(p_{0}-\czero)}{r}^{2}-\frac{(p_{1}-0.5)}{r}^{2}\\
f(\mbp;c_{0},r) & =\begin{cases}
\sqrt{g(\mbp;c_{0},r)} & \mbox{if }g(\mbp;c_{0},r)\geq0\\
0 & \mbox{if }g(\mbp;c_{0},r)<0
\end{cases}
\end{split}

r\sim\Norm(0.2,6.25\times10^{-4})

Finally, we will consider the following four types of OC variation patterns
 for the system:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Formula $\czero$

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f(\mbp;c_{0},r)\leftarrow f(\mbp;c_{0},r)+\delta$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Magnitude shift:
\series default
 all of the pixels are added an multiplicative disturbance 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f(\mbp;c_{0},r)\leftarrow f(\mbp;c_{0},r)*\delta$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the intensity of the change.
 Note that location shift and width shift represent disturbances in latent
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)$
\end_inset

.
 An important distinction between the two is that location equivariance
 is injected into convolutional networks but not scale equivariance, therefore
 we expect different reactions to these changes by deep convolutional latent
 variable models in terms of disentanglement.
 The other two cases, mean shift and magnitude shift, represent disturbances
 in the conditional distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx\g\mbz)$
\end_inset

.
 The training, validation, and testing IC or OC samples are generated of
 size 500 each.

On the disentanglement and extrapolation performance of the encoder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:simstudy:recognition"

\end_inset

 To investigate the disentanglement and extrapolation performance of the
 recognition network we employ the following procedure.
 First, we train a VAE with 2-dimensional latent code (for easier visualization)
 to convergence using in-control samples as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:simsetting"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Then, we a set of profiles with varying center location 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset

 and radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 into the recognition network to obtain their respective proposal distributions.
 The points are picked inside and outside the tolerance region of the two
 quality characteristics to be compared against their mapping onto the represent
ation space.
 Finally, we sample 150 points from the proposals and plot them on the represent
ation space.
 The results are shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:proposals"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 There are two important observations we would like to point out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Representations are partially entangled
\series default
.
 For every fixed center location, the direction of the axis on which radius
 change differs.
 The direction would have been independent from the fixed value of center
 location should the representations were disentangled.
 We may claim partial disentanglement for location but that would be quite
 unlikely if it wasn't for the translational equivariance injected in convolutio
nal layers

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Encoder cannot extrapolate for extremely values of radius.
 
\series default
Observe how from point 7 to 1, from point 6 to 0 and from point 8 to 2 the
 proposal means are converging to a point in the in-control region.
 This signals that the representations will not be able to extrapolate for
 even smaller values of radii.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these two observations, we can conclude right away that extremely
 small gaskets (in terms of radius) will likely be gone undetected.
 On the other hand, samples coming from some tolerable radius ranges—such
 as point 7— will be falsely identified as out-of-control.
 Observe for that point, how most sample latent codes fall outside the tolerable
 region in the inferred space.

 In other words, without extrapolation and disentanglement, we do not expect
 any monitoring statistic based purely on the output of the recognition
 network—such as

 It should be cross-examined with 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:proposals"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as the encoder and decoder are tightly coupled to each other.
 We observe two important behavior: the posterior gets distorted beyond
 two or three standard deviations and the representations are partially
 entangled in line with the behavior of its encoder depicted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:proposals"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 To see how this will help detecting disturbances in latent space, consider
 a gasket that is extremely large or at the very margins of the grid.
 Since the decoder cannot generate such a sample, there will be large pixel-to-p
ixel differences.
 This will in turn produce a larger monitoring statistic that will likely
 to fall outside the control limit.

On the estimation of log-likelihood under importance sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier, we claimed that it would take too many Monte Carlo sampling iterations
 to get a meaningful estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}\log\decoding$
\end_inset

.
 In this section we test that claim on a random sample 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx$
\end_inset

 using the proposal distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbz\sim\encoding$
\end_inset

 which is obtained via the encoder of the same VAE model we have been using
 in this section.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Estimation-comparison-between"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the results.
 The key observation is that it takes at least a few tens of Monte Carlo
 iterations to get a stable and accurate estimation.
 At that level, the single pass through encoder is negligible.
 This means using sampling will be more costly at least a factor of few
 tens to achieve the same accuracy as first-order approximation that we
 suggest.

Comparison of detection performance of proposed statistics

 Note that for all statistics that require sampling, we obtain a single
 sample and calculate the statistic based on that.
 This way we keep the computational demand same for all statistics and emulate
 the computational constraints of a real-life case.
 A preliminary result we must check is the robustness of the statistics
 by making sure all proposed statistics have roughly similar false alarm
 rate on the held-out in-control test set, which should also be reasonably
 close to the desired rate 5%.

 A commonality between the former three is that they don't rely on random

 To reiterate, disentanglement and failure to extrapolate in encoder is
 the reason behind this.

 shows the 2-D latent code of the AAE model given a set of OC samples.
 Since the 2-D latent code of OC samples are also close to the standard
 normal distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{2}$
\end_inset

 statistics will not be able to detect these OC behaviors.
 The ineffectiveness of 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{2}$

 statistics is validated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, where the density of 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{2}$

 distribution for OC and IC samples are largely overlapped.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the reconstruction error of the images given the same 2-D latent
 code.
 From these images, it is clear that the reconstructed images are very different
 from the OC images, where 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE$
\end_inset

 can be used to capture such changes.
 The effectiveness of

 is also shown in

, where the distributions of IC and OC samples do not have much overlap
 at all.

 Kullback-Leibler divergence between two multivariate Gaussian distributions
 has a closed form solution.
 If we define these distributions as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}=N(\mbz;\mbmu_{0},\mbSigma_{0})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=N(\mbz;\mbmu_{1},\mbSigma_{1})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbmu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbSigma$
\end_inset

 are respective mean vectors and covariance matrices, then according to
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hershey2007approximating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 the closed form solution will be the following: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\KL{p_{0}}{p_{1}} & =\frac{1}{2}[\log\frac{\g\mbSigma_{1}\g}{\g\mbSigma_{0}\g}+Tr(\mbSigma_{1}\inv\mbSigma_{0})-r\\
 & +(\mu_{0}-\mu{1})^{\top}\mbSigma_{1}\inv(\mu_{0}-\mu{1})]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding=\Norm(\mu(\mbx),\mbSigma_{z})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mbz)=\Norm(0,\mbI)$
\end_inset

, we can derive that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\KL{\encoding}{p(\mbz)} & =\frac{1}{2}\left[-\log\g\mbSigma_{z}\g+Tr(\mbSigma_{z})-r\right]+\frac{1}{2}\mu(\mbx)^{\top}\mu(\mbx)\\
 & =\frac{1}{2}\mu(\mbx)^{\top}\mu(\mbx)+C,
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=-\log\g\mbSigma_{z}\g+Tr(\mbSigma_{z})-r$
\end_inset

 is a constant, which doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx$
\end_inset

= & \mbx^{\top}\mbx-2\mu(\mbx)^{\top}\mbW\mbx+\mathbb{E}_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}(\mbz^{\top}\mbW^{\top}\mbW\mbz)\label{eq: spew}
\end{align}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we know that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & \mathbb{E}_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}(\mbz^{\top}\mbW^{\top}\mbW\mbz)\nonumber \\
= & \mathbb{E}_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}tr(\mbz^{\top}\mbW^{\top}\mbW\mbz)\nonumber \\
= & tr\left(\mbW^{\top}\mbW\mathbb{E}_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}(\mbz\mbz^{\top})\right)\nonumber \\
= & tr\left(\mbW^{\top}\mbW(\mu(\mbx)\mu(\mbx)^{\top}+\Sigma_{z})\right)\nonumber \\
= & \mu(\mbx)^{\top}\mbW^{\top}\mbW\mu(\mbx)+tr\left(\mbW^{\top}\mbW\Sigma_{z}\right)\label{eq: tracezwwz}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, by plugging 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: spew"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}\|\mbx-\mbW\mbz\|^{2} & =\mbx^{\top}\mbx-2\mu(\mbx)^{\top}\mbW\mbx+\mathbb{E}_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}(\mbz^{\top}\mbW^{\top}\mbW\mbz)\\
 & =\mbx^{\top}\mbx-2\mu(\mbx)^{\top}\mbW\mbx+\mu(\mbx)^{\top}\mbW^{\top}\mbW\mu(\mbx)+tr\left(\mbW^{\top}\mbW\Sigma_{z}\right)\\
 & =\|\mbx-\mbW\mu(\mbx)\|^{2}+C\\
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=tr\left(\mbW^{\top}\mbW\Sigma_{z}\right)$
\end_inset

 that does not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx$

Since

 is a diagonal matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $tr(H_{z}S_{z})=tr(diag(H_{z})S_{z})=\sum_{i}(H_{z})_{ii}(S_{z})_{ii}$
\end_inset

, and only diagonal element of 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{z}$
\end_inset

 is needed, so it can be computed efficiently.
