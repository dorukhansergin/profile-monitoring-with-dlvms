\change_inserted -767166615 1590439190
Toward a Better Statistic Formulation for Profile Monitoring with Variational
 Autoencoders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\change_inserted -767166615 1590519796
Due to the recent success of deep learning models, nonlinear profile monitoring
 schemes based on deep neural networks have attracted increasing interest.
 A number of such monitoring schemes were proposed specifically for variational
 autoencoders, a mainstay deep generative model.
 While these works show impressive results over classical methods, the statistic
 formulations they propose ignore shortcomings of learned lower-dimensional
 representations and computational limitations of real-world high-dimensional
 systems in their proposed formulations.
 In this work, we first manifest these issues and then overcome them with
 a novel statistic formulation that both increases out-of-control detection
 accuracy and computational efficiency.
 We demonstrate our results both on a carefully designed simulation study
 and a real-life example of image profiles obtained from a hot steel rolling
 process.

 A profile can be defined as a functional relationship between the response
 variables and explanatory variables or spatiotemporal coordinates.
 In this work, we focus on the case where the profiles generated from the
 process are high-dimensional (HD)

\begin_layout Standard
In literature, profile monitoring techniques can be categorized by their
 assumptions on the type of functional relationship.
 Linear profile monitoring can be considered the most basic profile monitoring
 technique, in which it is assumed that the profile can be represented by
 a linear function.
 The idea is to extract the slope and the intercept from each profile and
 monitor its coefficients 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zhu2009monitoring"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Regularization techniques can also be used in linear profile estimation.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "zou2012lasso"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 utilizes a multivariate linear regression model for profiles with the LASSO
 penalty and use the regression coefficients for Phase-II monitoring.
 However, the linearity assumption can be quite limiting.
 To address this challenge, nonlinear parametric models are proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Williams2007-ty,Jensen2009-tu,Noorossana2011-oj,Maleki2018-uo"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These models assume an explicit family of parameterized functions and,
 their parameters are estimated via nonlinear regression.
 In both cases, the drawback of both linear and nonlinear parametric models
 is that they assume the parametric form is known beforehand, which might
 not always be the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another large body of profile monitoring research focuses on the type of
 profiles where the basis of the representation is assumed to be known,
 but the coefficients are unknown.
 For instance, to monitor smooth profiles, various non-parametric methods
 based on local kernel regression 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zou2008monitoring,qiu2010nonparametric,zou2009nonparametric"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and splines 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chang2010statistical"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are developed.
 To monitor the non-smooth waveform signals, a wavelet-based mixed effect
 model is proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "paynabar2011characterization"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, for all the aforementioned methods, it is assumed that the nonlinear
 variation pattern of the profile is well captured by a known basis or kernel.
 Usually, there is no guidance on selecting the right basis of the representatio
n for the original data and it normally requires many trial and error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case that the basis of HD profiles are not known, dimensionality
 reduction techniques are widely used.
 Principal component analysis (PCA) is arguably the most popular method
 in this context for profile data monitoring because of its simplicity,
 scalability, and good data compression capability.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "liu1995control"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, PCA is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the streaming data and,
 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 charts are constructed to monitor the extracted representations and residuals,
 respectively.
 To generalize PCA methods to monitor the complex correlation among the
 channels of multi-channel profiles, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "paynabar2015change"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 propose a multivariate functional PCA method and apply change point detection
 methods on the function coefficients.
 Along this line, tensor-based PCA methods are also proposed for multi-channel
 profiles, examples including uncorrelated multi-linear PCA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "paynabar2013monitoring"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and multi-linear PCA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "grasso2014profile"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, various tensor-based PCA methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "yan2015image"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are compared and different test statistics are developed for tensor-based
 process monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main limitation of all the aforementioned PCA-related methods is that
 the expressive power of linear transformations is very limited.
 Furthermore, each principal component represents a global variation pattern
 of the original profiles, which is not efficient at capturing the local
 spatial correlation within a single profile.
 Therefore, PCA requires much larger latent space dimensions than the dimension
 of the actual latent space, yielding a sub-optimal and overfitting-prone
 representation.
 This phenomenon hinders profile monitoring performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A systematic discussion of this issue is articulated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Shi2016-tg"

\end_inset

.
 In that work, the authors identify the problems associated with assuming
 a closeness relationship in the subspace that is characterized by Euclidean
 metrics.
 They successfully observe that the intra-sample variation in complex high-dimen
sional corpora may lie on a nonlinear manifold as opposed to a linear manifold,
 which is assumed by PCA and related methods.
 However, the authors only focus on applying manifold learning for Phase-I
 analysis, while the Phase-II monitoring procedure is not touched upon

a number of
\change_inserted -767166615 1590444329

 reasons, especially when high-dimensional profiles are considered.
 In this work, we propose a new monitoring statistic formulation to address
 this issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contributions of this work are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We compare all the existing monitoring statistics for deep latent variable
 models with the focus on the VAE model and propose a better monitoring
 statistic that responds robustly and, in most cases, more accurately than
 previous formulations requiring only a single pass through the autoencoder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate and give insight on why latent
 variable-based monitoring statistics should not be used due to the two
 issues related to deep encoders: 1) their representations are likely entangled
 2) they will likely fail to extrapolate well beyond the region of in-control
 profiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We derive two approximations on the residual-based monitoring statistics
 leveraging on the first-order and second-order Taylor expansion and compare
 with the sampling-based monitoring statistics.
 We have demonstrated that the first-order approximation of the residual-based
 monitoring statistics gives the best detection accuracy and is computationally
 efficient.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new formulation on both simulation
 and real-life case studies and conclude that residual-based monitoring
 statistics with deep learning architecture as encoders and decoders outperform
 other monitoring statistics and the traditional methods.

\begin_layout Standard
Latent variables models are powerful tools to model complex distributions
 over high-dimensional spaces.
 The underlying assumption is that there exists a low-dimensional latent
 structure that explains well the variations in the high-dimensional observed
 space.
 Typically, the density over observed variables can be decoupled into the
 distribution on the latent variables 
\change_inserted -767166615 1590445034

\begin_inset Formula $\pz$

and the conditional distribution of observed variables given latent variables
 
\change_inserted -767166615 1590445338

\begin_inset Formula $p(\mbx\g\mbz)$
\end_inset

.
 Then, these distributions

can be assigned

A typical example of latent variable models is when the joint distribution
 is Gaussian factorized as in

 and conditional covariance is typically assumed to be isotropic 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}I_{d}$
\end_inset

 to avoid ill-defined problems.
 The aim is to approximate the true density 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\mbtheta}(\mbx)\approx p(\mbx)$
\end_inset

 and this approximation can be obtained through marginalization: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\mbtheta}(\mbx)=\int p_{\mbtheta}(\mbx,\mbz)d\mbz
\]

\end_inset

Finally, in literature, there have been discussions about whether the independen
t latent structure assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz=\Norm(\mbz;0,\mbI_{r})$
\end_inset

 can lead to the discovery of the true disentangled variations, a task also
 known as disentangled representation learning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Disentangled representations are useful to represent variations in latent
 variations due to their ability to separate the independent factors.
 However, a discussion on what disentangled representation implies for profile
 monitoring is necessary.
 We are interested in whether and if so, how such representations will be
 critical for profile monitoring.

A famous member of the family of models described above is the probabilistic
 principal component analysis (PPCA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 The parameters are optimized via a maximum likelihood estimation framework
 and it can be solved analytically since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\mbtheta}$
\end_inset

 is a simple linear transformation.
 This enables reusing analytical results from solutions to the classical
 PCA problem.
 The assumption of PPCA that the latent and observed variables have a strictly
 linear relationship is restrictive.
 In real-world processes, it is likely that this relationship is highly
 nonlinear.
 Deep latent variable models are a marriage of deep neural networks and
 latent variable models that aim to solve this problem.
 Deep learning has enjoyed a tremendous resurgence in the last decade due
 to their superior performance that was unprecedented for many tasks such
 as image classification

VAE is arguably the most foundational member of the deep latent variable
 model family.
 The main difference between PPCA and VAE is that VAE replaces the linear
 transformation with a high-capacity deep neural network (called 
\shape italic
generative
\shape default
 or 
\shape italic
decoder
\shape default
).
 This is powerful in the sense that, along with a general-purpose prior
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

, 
\change_deleted -767166615 1590458551

deep neural networks can transfer such prior into a wide variety of densities
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kingma2019introduction"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Unlike PPCA, these models will not have analytical solutions due to the
 complex nature of the neural network used.
 Like most other deep learning models, their parameters have to be optimized
 via gradient descent for maximum likelihood.
 The problem becomes even harder given the observation that the posterior
 
\begin_inset Formula $\decoding$
\end_inset

 takes meaningful values only for a small sub-region within 
\begin_inset Formula $\R^{r}$
\end_inset

.
 This makes sampling from the prior 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 to estimate the likelihood prohibitively expensive.
 Both models work around this problem using the importance sampling framework

 To understand the role of these two terms in process monitoring, we revisit
 the assumptions of the model described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 Let us formally represent an out-of-control distribution as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx)\neq p(\mbx)$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mbx)=\int p(\mbx\g\mbz)p(\mbz)d\mbz$
\end_inset

, we can observe two sources of out-of-control behaviors: disturbances in
 latent distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)\neq\pz$
\end_inset

 and disturbances in residual distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx\g\mbz)\neq p(\mbx\g\mbz)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that various combinations of these two disturbances cover disturbances
 in the entire process.
 One can argue that 
\begin_inset Formula $\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}\log\decoding$
\end_inset

 can detect the disturbances in the residual space 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx\g\mbz)\neq p(\mbx\g\mbz)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\KL{\encoding}{p(\mbz)}$
\end_inset

 can detect the disturbance in the latent space 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)\neq\pz$
\end_inset

.
 We know that for processes that can be accurately modeled by PCA, both
 terms play an important role 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 for process monitoring.
 We argue that this holds true for PPCA too.
 To prove this, we link the monitoring statistics of PCA (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 We know from the definition of PPCA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 that the prior, encoding and decoding functions are normally distributed
 as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{split}p(\mbz) & =\Norm(0,\mbI)\\
\decoding & =\Norm(\mbW\mbz,\sigma^{2}\mbI)\label{eq:Gaussian}
\end{split}
\]

\end_inset

In this case, from PPCA, the encoder also follows the normal distribution
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding=\Norm(\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx),\Sigma_{z})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)=\mbM^{-1}\mbW^{\top}\mbx$

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbM=\mbW^{\top}\mbW+\sigma^{2}\mbI$
\end_inset

.
 Then, the two monitoring statistics can be derived as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\KL{\encoding}{p(\mbz)}=\frac{1}{2}\gg\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)\gg^{2}+C_{1}\label{eqn:KL_PPCA}
\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbphi}}\log\decoding\propto\gg\mbx-\mbW\mu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)\gg^{2}+C_{2}\label{eqn:E_PPCA}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1}$

 are constants that doesn't depend on

 Unfortunately, injecting such inductive biases requires

 anticipation of variations among in-control samples as well as specialized
 neural network structures, both of which are extremely challenging tasks
 given the potential complexity of the processes that generate high-dimensional
 profiles.
 Moreover, even if the representations are disentangled, correct mappings
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 may still not be obtained due to failure to extrapolate.
 Deep neural networks approximate well only at a bounded domain defined
 by where the training setâ€”in our case, the in-control setâ€”is densely sampled
 from.
 The behavior of the function is often unpredictable outside that domain.
 In other words, it may not extrapolate well beyond the domain of training
 samples.
 We refer interested readers to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:rosenbrock"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 where we replicated this phenomenon on a toy example.
 To see why this is a problem, first note that the encoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 will only be trained with profiles densely sampled from the bounded region
 of in-control samples, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 are high.
 The behavior of the encoder is uncertain for profiles coming from dense
 regions of the out-of-control latent structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)\neq\pz$
\end_inset

.
 We expect increased false negatives should the model falsely map these
 profiles onto high-density regions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 but not 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike latent variable-based statistics, extrapolation and disentanglement
 issues in 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 along with extrapolation issues in 
\begin_inset Formula $\decoding$
\end_inset

 help residual-based statistic detect faults better.
 More interestingly, this holds true even when the disturbance is purely
 on the latent structure.
 First, if the encoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 map the

\change_inserted -767166615 1590533351

 domain, this will lead to the increase of the monitoring statistics based
 on the residual space for better detection power.
 Second, even if the mapping was correct and it maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{z}$
\end_inset

 outside the

 regions, which still leads to a large statistics to capture disturbances
 in latent variations.
 In conclusion,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see why this is the case, note that the encoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding$
\end_inset

 is optimized to produce samples more from where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pz$
\end_inset

 is large.
 In turn, the decoder 
\begin_inset Formula $\decoding$
\end_inset

 will mostly be trained on samples from where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)$
\end_inset

 is low.
 For disturbances in the residual space 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbx\g\mbz)\neq p(\mbx\g\mbz)$
\end_inset

, it is trivial to see how 
\begin_inset Formula $\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}\log\decoding$
\end_inset

 will be effective at capturing faults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of now, we have enough reasons to recommend the use of residual-based
 statistics as the only type of test statistics for the profile monitoring
 application that uses VAE.
 Indeed, variations of this type have been proposed previously: 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE$
\end_inset

 of

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "wang2019systematic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, they both use random samples from the proposal distribution to
 estimate the expectation.
 This approach may require a large number of samples to be generated and
 thus a large number of the forward passes on the decoder network, which
 is prohibitively expensive in terms of computation.
 Instead, we propose a Taylor expansion based approximation as the proposed
 statistic.
 First, observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\decoding\propto\gg x-\mbmu_{\mbtheta}(z)\gg_{2}^{2}+C$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbz$
\end_inset

 because of the common isotropic covariance assumption.
 The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 can be discarded as noneffective in terms of control charting because it
 would only translate the limits and the statistics by the same amount for
 any given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx$

\begin_inset Formula $\mbz$

 Let us call the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\gg x-\mbmu_{\mbtheta}(z)\gg_{2}^{2}$

 commonly used in deterministic autoencoders.
 We argue that, the Taylor expansion for the first moment of ERE given the
 random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbz\sim\encoding$
\end_inset

 can be used to approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\phi}}\gg x-\mbmu_{\mbtheta}(z)\gg_{2}^{2}$

Profile Monitoring Procedure

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

 A typical profile monitoring follows two phases: Phase-I analysis and Phase-II
 analysis.
 Phase-I analysis focuses on understanding the process variability by training
 an appropriate in-control mode, and selecting an appropriate control limit.
 In our case, Phase-I analysis results in a trained model (i.e.
\change_inserted -767166615 1590442792
,
\change_unchanged
 an encoder and a decoder) and an Upper Control Limit (UCL) to help set
 up the control chart for each of the monitoring statistics.
 In Phase-II, the system is exposed to new profiles generated by the process
 in real-time to decide whether these profiles are in-control or out-of-control.
 Our experimentation plan, outlined below, is formulated to emulate this
 scenario to effectively assess the performance of any combination of a
 model, a test statistic and a disturbance scenario to generate the out-of-contr
ol samples.

, convolutional layers have enabled tremendous performance increase in certain
 neural network applications where the data is of a certain spatial neighborhood
 structure such as images or audio waveform.
 They exploit an important observation of such data, where the learner should
 be equivariant to translations.
 This is an important injection of inductive bias into the network that
 largely reduces the number of parameters compared to the fully connected
 network by the use of parameter sharing.
 It eventually increases the statistical learning efficiency, especially
 for small samples.
 It must be noted, however, convolutional layers are not equivariant to
 scale and rotation as they are to translation.
 Knowing what sort of inductive biases is injected into these layers is
 important for the understanding of disentanglement, which we will introduce
 later in this paper.

 We first evaluate the performance of the deep latent variable models in
 a simulation setting inspired by the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The simulation procedure produces 2D point clouds that resemble the scanned
 topology of a gasket bead.
 Let each pixel on a 
\begin_inset Formula $64$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $64$
\end_inset

 grid be denoted by a tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbp=(p_{0},p_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 The values of the tuples stretch from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, equally spaced, left to right and bottom-up.
 Each tuple takes a value based on its location through a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbp\mapsto f(\mbp;\czero,r)+\epsilon$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\sim\Norm(0,1\times10^{-2})$
\end_inset

 is i.i.d Gaussian noise.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is parametrized by the horizontal center location of the bead 
\begin_inset Formula $\czero$
\end_inset

, and the radius of the bead 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 The vertical center of the bead is fixed to be at the center.
 Given any parameter set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{c_{0},r\}$
\end_inset

, each pixel 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbp$
\end_inset

 can be evaluated with the following logic: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}g(\mbp;c_{0},r) & =1-\frac{(p_{0}-\czero)}{r}^{2}-\frac{(p_{1}-0.5)}{r}^{2}\\
f(\mbp;c_{0},r) & =\begin{cases}
\sqrt{g(\mbp;c_{0},r)} & \mbox{if }g(\mbp;c_{0},r)\geq0\\
0 & \mbox{if }g(\mbp;c_{0},r)<0

 is injected into convolutional networks but not scale equivariance, therefore
 we expect different reactions to these changes by deep convolutional latent

To investigate the disentanglement and extrapolation performance of the
 recognition network, we employ the following procedure.
 First, we train a VAE with a 2-dimensional latent code (for easier visualizatio
n) to convergence using in-control samples as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:simsetting"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Then, we a set of profiles with varying center location 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset

 and radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 into the recognition network to obtain their respective proposal distributions.
 The points are picked inside and outside the tolerance region of the two
 quality characteristics to be compared against their mapping onto the represent
ation space.
 Finally, we sample 150 points from the proposals and plot them on the represent
ation space.
 The results are shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\change_inserted -767166615 1590510668

 There are two important observations we would like to point out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Representations are entangled
\series default
.
 For any of the fixed sources of variation, the variation in the other source
 is not axis-parallel and therefore the variations are entangled in the
 learned space.

\change_deleted -767166615 1590429518

\series default

\series bold
 
\change_deleted -767166615 1590429518
 
\series default
 
\change_unchanged
Observe how for the extremely high values of center location 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 or extremely low values of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 are the overall variation pattern starts getting distorted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these two observations and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Fixed-c-varying-r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we can conclude right away that gaskets with extremely small radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 will likely go undetected if only the latent variable-based statistic is
 used.
 This is an undesired consequence of the two aforementioned issues.
 The model seems to be more accurately responsive to the extreme values
 of center location 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 However, this is most likely due to translational equivariance injected
 into the model through convolutional layers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "locatello2018challenging"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In many real-life applications, the nature of variations in profiles will
 be more complex than simple translations in spatial or temporal domain.
 For such variations, it would be infeasible to inject required predicates
 due to the rigid architectures of deep neural networks.
 We already have radius as the evidence because convolutional layers are
 not scale equivariant.

 In other words, without extrapolation and disentanglement, we do not expect

\change_inserted -767166615 1590510941

as the encoder and decoder are tightly coupled to each other.
 We observe two important behavior: the posterior gets distorted beyond
 two or three standard deviations, and the representations are partially
 entangled in line with the behavior of its encoder depicted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:proposals"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 To see how this will help to detect disturbances in latent space, consider
 a gasket that is extremely small in term of the radius (i.e.
\change_inserted -767166615 1590442798
,
\change_unchanged
 small 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

) or at the very margins of the grid in terms of center location (i.e.
\change_inserted -767166615 1590442805
,
\change_unchanged
 center location 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 far from 0.5).
 Looking at 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:manifold_vae"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we can observe that the decoder simply cannot generate such a sample because
 it does not extrapolate well in either of latent dimensions.
 This will in turn produce a larger reconstruction error, and thus a larger
 monitoring statistic that will likely to fall outside the control limit.
 Recall once again that the disturbance described is purely on the latent
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\delta}(\mbz)$
\end_inset

 and yet our proposed monitoring statistic will capture this behavior well
 thanks to the extrapolation issues in the decoder.

Earlier, we claimed that it would take too many Monte Carlo sampling iterations
 to get a meaningful estimate of ERE defiend as 
\begin_inset Formula $\E_{\mbz\sim q_{\mbtheta}}\log\decoding$
\end_inset

.
 In this section, we test that claim on a random in-control sample 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx$
\end_inset

 using the proposal distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbz\sim\encoding$
\end_inset

 which is obtained via the encoder of the same VAE model we have been using
 in this section.
 The results of the sampling-based estimation of ERE, first-order approximation
 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$

.
 The key observation is that it takes at least a few tens of Monte Carlo
 iterations to get a stable and accurate estimation.
 At that level, the single pass through the encoder is negligible.
 This means using sampling will be more costly at least 
\change_deleted -767166615 1590105102
 
\change_unchanged
50 samples to achieve the same accuracy as the first-order approximation
 that we suggest and at least 80 samples to get the accuracy of the second-order
 approximation.
 Another important observation is that second-order approximation is a bit
 more accurate than first-order approximation since it is closer to the
 sample average approximation, but their difference is insignificant, and
 it requires much more computation.
 In the next subsection, we will evaluate the performance of 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$

 in Phase-II monitoring to evaluate whether the added computational complexity

 A preliminary result we must check is the robustness of the statistics

Through 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $ERE1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 over other methods when the disturbance is on the observable space (top
 row).
 Latent variable-based statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

 fail in this case since that they are purely computed using the proposal
 distribution latent variables.
 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 also outperforms 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE/R$
\end_inset

, although by a smaller margin it has with the latent variable-statistics.
 Between 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 it's hard to claim whether one works than the other as their mean performances
 are quite close to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the latter two disturbances occurring purely on latent dimensions, results
 are presented in the bottom row of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 The key observations can be listed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We observe mixed results but generally 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{2}$
\end_inset

 tend to perform better than 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE/R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 A commonality between the former three is that they don't rely on random
 samples, supporting our argument against this practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Observe the radius shift type disturbance show in the bottom left figure.
 Even though 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{2}$
\end_inset

 performs better on positive intensities (larger radii), it completely misses
 negative intensities (smaller radii).
 We foresaw this result in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:simstudy:recognition"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 To reiterate, disentanglement and the lack of extrapolation in the encoder
 is the reason behind this.
 We would also suggest that this result can extend to all the latent-variable
 based statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unlike latent variable-based statistics, 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE/R$
\end_inset

 behave more robustly against varying intensities.
 In other words, the detection rate increase with increased intensities
 consistently.
 Among these, we observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 consistently outperform 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE/R$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 perform very similarly.
 In this case, we conclude that the second-order information does not help
 too much for the Phase-II monitoring.
 The reason behind this is that the second-order information encode the
 variance of the encoded latent variables, which are required by the encoders.
 However, given encoders would provide inaccurate information in the

\change_inserted -767166615 1590533402

 Therefore, it does not provide additional gain for the monitoring performance.

.
 There are 13 classes of surface defect types identified by the domain engineers.
 Four of these classesâ€”0,1,9 and 11â€”are considered minor defects and they
 constitute our in-control set.
 There are in total 338 images in these classes.
 The other nine classes make up the

 for.

 Same as in the simulation study, to account for randomness in weight initializa
tion, we replicate the experiment with 10 different seeds.
 For comparison, we also include the monitoring performance with the traditional
 PCA method with the same residual-based control chart, denoted as PCA-Q.

From

, we can observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 consistently outperforms all other statistic formulations.
 The divide between residual-based statistics and latent variable-based
 statistics observed in simulation study is replicated here too.
 The inferiority of latent variable-based statistics are much more obvious
 here, as we observe for most out-of-control classes the detection rate
 is simply zero.
 This observation further validate our claims that in practice, for deep
 autoencoders, the change happens in the residual space rather than the
 latent space.
 The advantage of VAE over PCA is mainly due to the better representative
 power and data compression ability of deep autoencoders compared to PCA.
 We replicated the superiority of VAE over PCA for process monitoring the
 same way it was demonstrated in the earlier works mentioned in this study

I don't see how 1 and 2 will help answer our research question.
 Linear layers may require more number of parameters (I'm assuming by number
 you mean the dimensionality of latent variable becuase it can be mistaken
 to the trainable parameters and there, deep learning clearly has more parameter
s) but what is your rationale behind why this hurts detection performance?
 2) Yes, this is true but we already mentioned the linear-nonlinear manifold
 story.
 I think that's enough.
 Also, I don't even know why we include performance against PCA when all
 other papers already demonstrated that.
 Can't we just refer to their work? It's really not central to our discussion.
 If they want we can add it later in the revision.
 If they wouldn't require that but they see in Rolling, they will ask the
 same thing for Gasket and for absolutely no reason we would have to go
 through the additional responsibility of doing that for Gasket.
 If you are convinced, please go ahead and delete the second table and the
 single paragraph about PCA comparison above.

I talked with Kamran before and he really likes the special issue to show
 the advantage of the deep learning over traditional methods.
 Another reason is that reviewers will ask this question for a high chance...

Even though this has been shown by other people.
 I still like to keep this.
 However, I felt that making it as two tables are indeed cubersome since
 there are many redudant information.
 So what I did is simply merge these two tables.
 BUt I agree that we can keep it short and so I just least one sentence
 and give a citation.

From

, we can observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 consistently outperforms all other statistic formulations.
 The divide between residual-based statistics and latent variable-based
 statistics observed in simulation study is replicated here too.
 The inferiority of latent variable-based statistics are much more obvious
 here, as we observe for most out-of-control classes the detection rate
 is simply zero.
 This observation further validate our claims that in practice, for deep
 autoencoders, the change happens in the residual space rather than the
 latent space.
 The advantage of VAE over PCA is mainly due to the better representative
 power and data compression ability of deep autoencoders compared to PCA.
 We replicated the superiority of VAE over PCA for process monitoring the
 same way it was demonstrated in the earlier works mentioned in this study

 We observe how well separated the statistics are for 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE/R$
\end_inset

 while for latent variable-based statistics the obtained values are mostly
 overlapping.
 Note that we omitted 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

because it was almost identical to 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 To obtain a deeper understanding of the results, we point out 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Output-of-the"

\end_inset

 below for the original images and their reconstructions.
 Decoder is persistent on generating samples that look like in-control rolling
 samples with little fidelity to how the original defect sample looks like.
 When 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 are cross-examined, it is apparent why reconstruction error would be high.
 On the contrary, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Inferred-means"

 shows that most latent representations fall into the region that would
 be considered in-control from a profile monitoring perspective.
 We observe instances of class 3,5,6 and 7 generate the latent variables

 However, even for these classes, 
\begin_inset Formula $SPE/R$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

 yields much better detection power than 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

, as it can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:rolling_results"

\end_inset

 In conclusion, we would like to suggest the use of 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 for deep autoencoders, which is consistent with our findings in the simulation
 study.

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we focus on evaluating Phase-II monitoring statistics proposed
 so far in the literature for VAE and demonstrate that they were not performing
 optimally in terms of accuracy and/or computational feasibility.
 First, we point out two important issues related to the latent variables
 learned by the encoder of VAE, namely, entanglement and failure to extrapolate.
 Based on these issues, we argue that latent variable-based statistics should
 be discarded altogether with both conceptual explanations and real experiments.
 Second, we point out that the residual-based statistics based on sampling
 will require too many samples to be computationally feasible.
 Finally, we propose a novel formulation by deriving the Taylor expansion
 of expected reconstruction error that addresses both accuracy and computational
 efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support our claim, our simulation study first demonstrates the entanglement
 and lack of extrapolation of latent variable-based statistics and its inferior
 Phase-II monitoring performance.
 It further shows that the derived statistics based on the residual space
 is more robust and more accurate than all the other statistics proposed
 so far.
 Finally, we validate the superiority of our formulation on a real-life
 case study, where steel defect image profiles are used.

\begin_layout Standard
Kullback-Leibler divergence between two multivariate Gaussian distributions
 has a closed-form solution.
 If we define these distributions as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}=N(\mbz;\mbmu_{0},\mbSigma_{0})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=N(\mbz;\mbmu_{1},\mbSigma_{1})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbmu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbSigma$
\end_inset

 are respective mean vectors and covariance matrices, then according to
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hershey2007approximating"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 the closed-form solution will be the following: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\KL{p_{0}}{p_{1}} & =\frac{1}{2}[\log\frac{\g\mbSigma_{1}\g}{\g\mbSigma_{0}\g}+Tr(\mbSigma_{1}\inv\mbSigma_{0})-r+(\mbmu_{0}-\mbmu_{1})^{\top}\mbSigma_{1}\inv(\mbmu_{0}-\mbmu_{1})]\label{eq:kld-closed-form}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding=\Norm(\mbmu(\mbx),\mbSigma_{z})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mbz)=\Norm(0,\mbI)$
\end_inset

, we can derive that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\KL{\encoding}{p(\mbz)} & =\frac{1}{2}\left[-\log\g\mbSigma_{z}\g+Tr(\mbSigma_{z})-r\right]+\frac{1}{2}\mbmu(\mbx)^{\top}\mbmu(\mbx)\nonumber \\
 & =\frac{1}{2}\mbmu(\mbx)^{\top}\mbmu(\mbx)+C,\label{eq:kld-prior}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=-\log\g\mbSigma_{z}\g+Tr(\mbSigma_{z})-r$
\end_inset

 is a constant, which doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbx$

Here, we know that

A Toy Example to Demonstrate Out-of-distribution Behavior of Neural Networks

\begin_layout Standard
Assume using a multilayer perceptron, we are trying to approximate the famous
 Rosenbrock function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y)=(a-x)^{2}+b(y-x^{2})^{2}$
\end_inset

 given 
\begin_inset Formula $(a,b)=(1,100)$
\end_inset

.
 In this small experiment, we sample tuples of two-dimensional points from
 a bounded region 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i},y_{i})\in[-1,3]\times[-2,3]$
\end_inset

.
 We use a multilayer perceptron with six hidden layers and a hundred neurons
 in each layer.
 Half of the points are used in training, and the other half is used as
 a validation set to optimize hyper-parameters.
 Using the trained network, we plot the actual Rosenbrock function along
 with the neural network approximation in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Rosenbrock"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Notice how well the function is approximated for the region 
\begin_inset Formula $[-1,3]\times[-2,3]$
\end_inset

, but there is a serious discrepancy between the approximated and the real
 outside of the region.
 This is a small yet to the point example of out-of-distribution issues
 with neural networks.

here needs a bit more neat explanation of everything, such as what q (it's
 a normal distrbution with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)$
\end_inset

 and covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $\diag(\mbsigma_{\mbphi}(\mbx))$
\end_inset

) is and what Hz is etc.
 I think what you mean by R''(z) is Hz.
 I'm not sure where exactly trace is introduced, but probably the derivation
 here led to that https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/34477/expected-value-a

\begin_layout Standard
To derive the 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

, we first define 
\begin_inset Formula $R(z)=\|y-\mbmu_{\mbtheta}(z)\|^{2}$
\end_inset

 as the reconstruction error (RE).
 The quantity we would like approximate is 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mbz\sim q_{\phi}}R(\mbz)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\encoding=\Norm(\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx),\Sigma_{z})$
\end_inset

.
 We are looking for the Taylor expansion of the expected RE (ERE) around
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{0}=\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)$
\end_inset

,

 the first moment.
 For notational simplicity, we use 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{z}$
\end_inset

 to denote the Hessian 
\begin_inset Formula $R''(\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))$
\end_inset

.
 The derivation is formalized as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
E_{\mbz\sim q_{\phi}}R(\mbz) & =R(\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))+R'(\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))E_{\mbz\sim q_{\phi}}[\mbz-\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)])\nonumber \\
 & \quad+\frac{1}{2}E_{\mbz\sim q_{\phi}}[(\mbz-\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))^{\top}\mathbf{H}_{z}(\mbz-\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))]+O(\|(\mbz-\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx)\|^{3}\nonumber \\
 & \simeq R(\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))+\frac{1}{2}E_{\mbz\sim q_{\phi}}[(\mbz-\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))^{\top}\mathbf{H}_{z}(\mbz-\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))]\nonumber \\
 & =R(\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))+\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{H}_{z}E[(\mbz-\mbmu_{z})(\mbz-\mbmu_{z})^{T}])\nonumber \\
 & =R(\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))+\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{H}_{z}\Sigma_{z})\label{eq:derived-ere2}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note for 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{1}$
\end_inset

, the second term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{H}_{z}\Sigma_{z})$
\end_inset

 drops and we are left with 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mbmu_{\mbphi}(\mbx))$
\end_inset

 only.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 is a diagonal matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{H}_{z}S_{z})=\mathrm{tr}(diag(\mathbf{H}_{z})S_{z})=\sum_{i}(\mathbf{H}_{z})_{ii}(S_{z})_{ii}$
\end_inset

 holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can utilize this result to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $ERE_{2}$
\end_inset

, in a more computationally efficient manner.
