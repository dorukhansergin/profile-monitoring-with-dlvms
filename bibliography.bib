  author    = "Li, Bo and Wang, Kaibo and Yeh, Arthur B",
  abstract  = "In many industrial multivariate quality control applications,
               based on the engineering and operational understanding of how
               the process works, when the process variability is out of
               control, it is typically the case that changes only occur in a
               small number of elements in the covariance matrix. Under such a
               premise, we propose a new Phase II Shewhart chart for monitoring
               changes in covariance matrix of a multivariate normal process.
               The new control chart is essentially based on calculating the
               likelihood ratio of testing the hypothesis that the in-control
               covariance matrix is equal to a known covariance matrix, where
               the unknown covariance matrix which appears in the likelihood
               ratio is replaced by an estimate obtained from a penalized
               likelihood function. The penalized likelihood function is
               derived by adding an L 1 penalty function to the usual
               likelihood. The performance of the proposed chart is evaluated
               based on simulations and compared to that of several existing
               Shewhart charts for monitoring the covariance matrix. The
               simulation results indicate that the proposed chart outperforms
               the existing charts. A real example from the semi-conductor
               industry is presented and analyzed using the proposed chart and
               other existing charts. Potential future research directions are
               also discussed. Article just-accepted.",

              which a model is constructed to describe ``normal'' training

               is no ideal method to monitor and ensure the quality of AM
               during the modeling process. In AM, the model is built layer by
               layer and the defects emerge gradually, so the defects might not
               be found immediately during the manufacturing process. With the
               accumulation of the inaccuracies, the quality of model would be

               Deposition Modeling (FDM) is studied by the method of combining
               the Machine Vision (MV) and Statistical Process Control (SPC).

              is commonly used to identify linear variation patterns in
              high-dimensional data. While principal component scores represent
              uncorrelated features, standard backpropagation methods for
              training ANNs provide no guarantee of producing distinct
              features, which is important for interpretability and for
              discovering the nature of the variation patterns in the data.
              Here, we present an alternating nonlinear PCA method, which
              encourages learning of distinct features in ANNs. A new measure
              motivated by the condition of orthogonal loadings in PCA is
              proposed for measuring the extent to which the nonlinear

  abstract = "Abstract High-dimensional data in Euclidean space pose special
              challenges to data mining algorithms. These challenges are often
              indiscriminately subsumed under the term ?curse of
              dimensionality?, more concrete aspects being the so-called
              ?distance concentration effect?, the presence of irrelevant
              attributes concealing relevant information, or simply efficiency
              issues. In about just the last few years, the task of
              unsupervised outlier detection has found new specialized
              solutions for tackling high-dimensional data in Euclidean space.
              These approaches fall under mainly two categories, namely
              considering or not considering subspaces (subsets of attributes)
              for the definition of outliers. The former are specifically
              addressing the presence of irrelevant attributes, the latter do
              consider the presence of irrelevant attributes implicitly at best
              but are more concerned with general issues of efficiency and
              effectiveness. Nevertheless, both types of specialized outlier
              detection algorithms tackle challenges specific to
              high-dimensional data. In this survey article, we discuss some

               industry. However, in many applications, abnormal data are
               difficult to be collected and are not available during training.
               In this paper, we propose a one class fault detection scheme for
               multi-dimensional problems, based on the unsupervised training
               of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The generator tries
               to learn the manifold of normal behavior of the process, while
               the final decision of fault occurrence is taken from the
               discriminator. The network architectures of the discriminator
               and the generator and the hyper-parameters, that are used during
               training, are crucial for the stability of the GAN model. To
               ensure system convergence during training and to enhance the
               accuracy of the unsupervised classifier, a model selection
               algorithm is used. The latter one evaluates each trained model
               on a validation set of the normal training dataset, based on a
               proposed performance metric. Also, a method for evaluating the
               generating ability of each trained generative model is
               introduced, based on the reconstruction cost of an Autoencoder
               (AE). The proposed evaluation method of generative models, is
               used on the search algorithm, which selects the final classifier

  abstract  = "Many existing aircraft engine fault detection methods are highly
               dependent on performance deviation data that are provided by the
               original equipment manufacturer. To improve the independent
               engine fault detection ability, Aircraft Communications
               Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) data can be used.
               However, owing to the characteristics of high dimension, complex
               correlations between parameters, and large noise content, it is
               difficult for existing methods to detect faults effectively by
               using ACARS data. To solve this problem, a novel engine fault
               detection method based on original ACARS data is proposed.
               First, inspired by computer vision methods, all variables were
               divided into separated groups according to their correlations.
               Then, an improved convolutional denoising autoencoder was used

  abstract  = "Fault diagnosis of electric motors is a fundamental task for
               production line testing, and it is usually performed by
               experienced human operators. In the recent years, several
               methods have been proposed in the literature for detecting
               faults automatically. Deep neural networks have been
               successfully employed for this task, but, up to the authors'
               knowledge, they have never been used in an unsupervised
               scenario. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for
               diagnosing faults of electric motors by using a novelty
               detection approach based on deep autoencoders. In the proposed
               method, vibration signals are acquired by using accelerometers
               and processed to extract LogMel coefficients as features.
               Autoencoders are trained by using normal data only, i.e., data
               that do not contain faults. Three different autoencoders
               architectures have been evaluated: the multilayer perceptron
               (MLP) autoencoder, the convolutional neural network autoencoder,
               and the recurrent autoencoder composed of long short-term memory
               (LSTM) units. The experiments have been conducted by using a
               dataset created by the authors, and the proposed approaches have
               been compared to the one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM)
               algorithm. The performance has been evaluated in terms area
               under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic
               curve, and the results showed that all the autoencoder-based
               approaches outperform the OCSVM algorithm. Moreover, the MLP
               autoencoder is the most performing architecture, achieving an
               AUC equal to 99.11\%.",

              shortcomings of traditional ICA based fault detection method, an
              improved ICA method, referred to as dynamic Bayesian independent
              component analysis (DBICA), is proposed to monitor the multimode
              non-Gaussian dynamic process. In this method, matrix dynamic
              augmentation is applied to extract dynamic information from
              original data. Then for analyzing multimode non-Gaussian data,
              Bayesian inference and ICA are combined to establish a

                   have been developed to solve various fault detection and
                   diagnosis problems. Since PCA-based methods assume that the
                   monitored process is linear, nonlinear PCA models, such as
                   autoencoder models and kernel principal component analysis
                   (KPCA), has been proposed and applied to nonlinear process
                   monitoring. However, KPCA-based methods need to perform
                   eigen-decomposition (ED) on the kernel Gram matrix whose
                   dimensions depend on the number of training data. Moreover,
                   prefixed kernel parameters cannot be most effective for
                   different faults which may need different parameters to
                   maximize their respective detection performances.
                   Autoencoder models lack the consideration of orthogonal
                   constraints which is crucial for PCA-based algorithms. To
                   address these problems, this paper proposes a novel
                   nonlinear method, called neural component analysis (NCA),
                   which intends to train a feedforward neural work with
                   orthogonal constraints such as those used in PCA. NCA can
                   adaptively learn its parameters through backpropagation and

               special importance. Although there are several methods for image
               denoising and anomaly detection, most of these perform denoising
               and detection sequentially, which affects detection accuracy and
               efficiency. Additionally, the low computational speed of some of
               these methods is a limitation for real-time inspection. In this
               article, we develop a novel methodology for anomaly detection in
               noisy images with smooth backgrounds. The proposed method, named
               smooth-sparse decomposition, exploits regularized
               high-dimensional regression to decompose an image and separate
               anomalous regions by solving a large-scale optimization problem.
               To enable the proposed method for real-time implementation, a

              method is a computational intelligent machine learning algorithm

              and to render better accuracy in detecting defects. This is
              achieved by using Bayesian statistics methodology. The proposed
              method is demonstrated on automatic detection of defect in

              led to better detection performance. Experimental tests and

               applications in manufacturing systems improvement, but it is
               nontrivial to develop efficient statistical methods because
               profiles are high-dimensional functional data with intrinsic
               inner- and interchannel correlations, and that the change might

               two steps of dimension reduction: It first applies the

               under the in-control state, and then uses the soft-thresholding
               techniques to further select significant features capturing

  abstract = "In modern manufacturing, approaches for profile monitoring can be
              adopted to detect unnatural behaviors of production processes,
              i.e. to signal when the relationship used to represent the
              profiles changes with time. Most of the literature concerned with
              profile monitoring deals with the problem of model identification
              and multivariate charting of parameters vector. In this paper, a
              different approach, which is based on an unsupervised neural
              network, is presented for profile monitoring. The neural network
              allows a computer to automatically learn from data the
              relationship to represent in-control profiles. Then, the
              algorithm may produce a signal when an input profile does not fit
              to the prototype learned from the in-control ones. The neural
              network does not require an analytical model for the statistical
              description of profiles faced (model-free approach). A comparison
              study is provided in this paper, in which the Phase II
              performance of the neural network is compared to that of
              approaches representative of the industrial practice. Performance
              is assessed by computer simulation, with reference to a case
              study related to profiles measured on machined items subject to
              geometrical specification (roundness). The results indicate that
              the neural network may outperform usual control charts in
              signaling out-of-control conditions, due to spindle-motion errors
              in several production scenarios. The proposed approach can be

               surfaces that satisfy the locality and stationarity properties

               metrology data for machined, cast, or formed metal parts;
               microscopy images of material microstructure samples; etc. To
               characterize the complex spatial statistical dependencies of
               in-control samples of the stochastic textured surface, we use
               rather generic supervised learning methods, which provide an
               implicit characterization of the joint distribution of the
               surface texture. We propose two spatial moving statistics, which
               are computed from residual errors of the fitted supervised
               learning model, for monitoring and diagnosing local aberrations

               challenges on traditional and next-generation innovation
               practices for process monitoring and control in manufacturing
               and healthcare. Traditional statistical process control (SPC) is

               address complex structures of high-dimensional imaging profiles.
               Realizing the full potential of advanced imaging technology for
               process monitoring and control hinges on the development of new

              information on product geometry, surface defects, surface finish,
              and other product and process characteristics. Previous research
              for monitoring these visual characteristics using image data has
              focused on either detecting changes within an image or between
              images. Extending these methods to include both the spatial and
              the temporal aspects of image data would provide more detailed
              diagnostic information, which would be of great value to
              industrial practitioners. Therefore, in this article, we show how
              image data can be monitored using a spatiotemporal framework that
              is based on an extension of a generalized likelihood ratio
              control chart. The performance of the proposed method is
              evaluated through computer simulations and experimental studies.
              The results show that our proposed spatiotemporal method is
              capable of quickly detecting the emergence of a fault. The
              computer simulations also show that our proposed generalized

              important fault diagnostic metrics that are not typically

                   predictions for inputs that were drawn from a different
                   distribution than that of the training data. A plethora of
                   work has demonstrated that it is easy to find or synthesize
                   inputs for which a neural network is highly confident yet
                   wrong. Generative models are widely viewed to be robust to
                   such mistaken confidence as modeling the density of the
                   input features can be used to detect novel,
                   out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper we challenge this
                   assumption. We find that the density learned by flow-based
                   models, VAEs, and PixelCNNs cannot distinguish images of
                   common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.e.
                   CIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.e. SVHN), assigning
                   a higher likelihood to the latter when the model is trained
                   on the former. Moreover, we find evidence of this phenomenon
                   when pairing several popular image data sets: FashionMNIST
                   vs MNIST, CelebA vs SVHN, ImageNet vs CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 /
                   SVHN. To investigate this curious behavior, we focus
                   analysis on flow-based generative models in particular since
                   they are trained and evaluated via the exact marginal
                   likelihood. We find such behavior persists even when we
                   restrict the flows to constant-volume transformations. These
                   transformations admit some theoretical analysis, and we show
                   that the difference in likelihoods can be explained by the
                   location and variances of the data and the model curvature.
                   Our results caution against using the density estimates from
                   deep generative models to identify inputs similar to the
                   training distribution until their behavior for
                   out-of-distribution inputs is better understood.",

    abstract = { Factor analysis, principal component analysis, mixtures of gaussian clusters, vector quantization, Kalman filter models, and hidden Markov models can all be unified as variations of unsupervised learning under a single basic generative model. This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models. }
